#
# WallFly[BZZZ] Discord Bot
# 2022 RailWolf
#
# Currently has Goto plus Magic 8 Ball
# Uses discordrb gem
# This requires a few pieces from dorkbuster to operate. server-info.cfg and all-servers.cfg must be configured.
# q2cmd.rb and all-servers.cfg need symlinks in the bot's cwd
# Set discord token in bot_cfg.rb. The paths in bot_cfg.rb shouldn't change unless you've changed the folder structure for some reason :P
# Note server-status.rb currently uses Ruby 1.8.6 and WallFly[BZZZ] Discord Bot uses 3.1+
