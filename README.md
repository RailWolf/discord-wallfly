WallFly[BZZZ] Discord Bot 

2022 RailWolf

Currently has Goto plus Magic 8 Ball

This requires a few pieces from dorkbuster to operate. all-servers.cfg must be configured.
 
q2cmd.rb and all-servers.cfg need symlinks in the bot's cwd

Set discord token in bot_cfg.rb. The paths in bot_cfg.rb shouldn't change unless you've changed the folder structure for some reason :P
